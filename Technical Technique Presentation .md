## Introduction
- I was Put in a Team to show a Technical Technique in Data Wrangling and the technique i will be showing is how to Generate Unseen Data.
- This presentation aims to show how to generate an Unseen Data from a fraction of a data for machine learning. ie Regression or Classification.

## Background
- Data Wrangling will be done in Python using Jupiter Notebook. The Python Library i will use is Pandas.
- Pandas offer a variety of functions which make data wrangling less challenging.  

## Presentation Candidate
- Chidera Ubanatu. Bsc Pure and Industrial Chemistry.
- Business Inteligence Analysis student at NSCC.
- Data Skills: Python, SQL, PowerBI Report.

## Sample Data Selection
- This Data was selected so we can split the data to predict Sales features.
- This Data set was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thorgodofthunder/tvradionewspaperadvertising/code
- It has 200 records and 4 features.

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data preprocessing, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and enriching raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Steps to take: (1). Read in the csv file,
                 (2). Do Exploratory Data Analysis like getting the shape of the data
                 (3). Generate Unseen Data
                 (4). Drop the unseen Data from the Data and load it to a Data Frame
                 (5). Export the data to a csv file.
- This will help you to run a machine learnng model and test on both the Data taine and the Unseen data.

## Implementation Plan
- Day 1. Get a sample Data
- Day 2. Load the data to pandas using jupyter notebook and execute your code. 
- Entire presentation was done in Python using Pandas in Jupyter notebook.
- Two Practice sessions and one dry run

## Conclusion
- This presentation will achieve a Technical technique in Data Wrangling using pandas it will show some data cleaning techniques and exploratory data analysis.
  Also it will show how to split a fraction of a data to be used for machine learning.
