## Introduction
- I was Put in a Team to show a Technical Technique in Data Wrangling and the technique i will be showing is how to Generate Unseen Data.
- This presentation aims to show how to generate an unseen data from a fraction of a data for machine learning. ie Regression or Classification.

## Background
- Data Wrangling will be done in Python using Jupiter Notebook. The Python Library i will use is Pandas.
- Pandas offer a variety of functions which make data wrangling less challenging.
