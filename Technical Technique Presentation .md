## Introduction
- I was Put in a Team to show a Technical Technique in Data Wrangling and the technique i will be showing is how to Generate Unseen Data.
- This presentation aims to show how to generate an Unseen Data from a fraction of a data for machine learning. ie Regression or Classification.

## Background
- Data Wrangling will be done in Python using Jupiter Notebook. The Python Library i will use is Pandas.
- Pandas offer a variety of functions which make data wrangling less challenging.  

## Presentation Candidate
- Chidera Ubanatu. Bsc Pure and Industrial Chemistry.
- Business Inteligence Analysis student at NSCC.
- Data Skills: Python, SQL, PowerBI Report.

## Sample Data Selection
- This Data was selected so we can split the data to predict Sales features.
- This Data set was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thorgodofthunder/tvradionewspaperadvertising/code
- It has 200 records and 4 features.

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data preprocessing, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and enriching raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Steps to take: Read in the csv file, 
- Expected outcomes and benefits

## Implementation Plan
- Timeline for the preparation of the presentation
- Resources required (software, hardware, etc.)
- Practice sessions and dry runs

## Conclusion
- Summary of what will be achieved with the presentation
- Call to action for the audience

## Appendices
- References to technical literature
- Links to resources for further reading
