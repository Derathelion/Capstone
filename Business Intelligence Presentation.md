## Introduction
- Business intelligence (BI) refers to the use of data analysis tools and techniques to extract actionable insights from raw data. In this presentation i will be showing some Businesss Intelligence technique
  which involves collecting, analyzing, and presenting data to support decision-making processes within an organization.
- Goals of the presentation is to leverage Data-driven decision-making which involves using data analysis to inform business strategies and actions. 

## Presentation Candidate
- Chidera Ubanatu. Bsc Pure and Industrial Chemistry.
- Business Inteligence Analysis student at NSCC.
- Data Skills: Python, SQL, PowerBI Report.
  
## Data Selection
- The Superstore dataset was selected for its richness and diversity of data, including sales, customer, and product information. It allows for comprehensive analysis and visualization of various business metrics.
- This Data set was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final.
- The Superstore dataset is a US retail company's operations, making it relevant to businesses in the retail industry. The insights derived from this dataset can be applied to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- The presentation will showcase various BI techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Data Visualization.
- I will demonstrate how to explore and analyze the Superstore dataset using BI tools such as Pandas, SQL and Power BI. I will walk through the process of creating interactive visualizations, performing trend analysis, and increase revenue.
- The presentation aims to uncover insights related to sales trends, customer behaviour, and product performance. These insights can inform strategic decisions such as inventory management, marketing campaigns, and pricing strategies.

## Implementation Plan
- Data Exploration and Analysis: Week 1-2
  Visualization Design and Development: Week 3-4
  Presentation Preparation and Rehearsals: Week 5
- Presentation was done in PowerBI, MS SSMS, Python using Pandas in Jupyter notebook.
- Two Practice sessions and one dry run.

## Conclusion
- This report proposal outlines the plan for creating a visualization report on the Superstore dataset, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making and the application of BI techniques in driving business 
 insights.
